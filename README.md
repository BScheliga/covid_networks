### R code to find complete clusters of COVID cases & contacts

This code takes an input file of index cases and contacts from the COVID Case Management System. 
It maps and summarises networks of people who have been in contact over time.

Two summary files are made: one about cases & contacts and the second about network growth and membership. 
A PDF plot of each network is also made.

Questions please contact JessicaButler@abdn.ac.uk
